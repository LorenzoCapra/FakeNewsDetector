# FakeNewsDetector
A repository containing the ML framework used to tackle
the problem of fake news detection. To make it work, follow 
the subsequent steps:

1. Download a Training and a Testing dataset from wherever 
you want (Kaggle is a very good place);
   
2. Run "FakeNewsDetector.py" changing the name of the datasets
in the first lines according to what you downloaded in step 1;

3. At the end of step 2 you should have a trained model, with 
printed out on screen its accuracy;

4. Run "MAIN" and input the text you'd like to try the model on.
Please notice that results depend on how you insert the text:
when dealing with multiple paragraphs, skip the space between lines.
